# wanna-hang-out
## About
I mainly explained the reason why I chose this on the site's about page, but it is basically a tool for people in long distance friendships or relationships to spend more time together to ensure they feel close even when they're physically apart. I came up with this idea because it was the first "community" I could think of that I am a part of that I felt needed something to help people in it.

As for the design of the website itself, I wanted to make it bright and fun with the colors, shapes, and fonts included, since being in a long distance frienship or relationship can be sad at times. I wanted the interface to be easy to understand and navigate, while having useful, functioning results that can inspire people to figure out "what to do today".

## Process
I first wanted to reach out to any other people in long distance friendships/relationships through my instagram to get more data and individual experiences besides mine. I made a google quiz and asked a few questions about their relationship and what kind of activities they do with their friend or partner, for inspiration. I talked to one person specifically who liked my idea and agreed that people in this situation can relate a lot because it can be hard at times.

I started with some sketches of the layout I was thinking.

Above, I included some photos of my code, because I couldn't figure out how to make the links display to be clickable and open in a new window. I made them objects in javaScript, called "link:" and this text is to be displayed in the id "text", which works fine, but I am unsure of a way for it to actually display a link as a link. I didn't add 'href=""' to the "a" element on the result page because I wasnt sure how to replace the text inside the href quotes to be the link itself, whithout putting the id="text" inside of the href quotes. which doesn't make sense in terms of syntax.

This was my only big problem that I faced, besides figuring out how to use the javaScript objects to display all of the associated information at random, making my website function properly.
