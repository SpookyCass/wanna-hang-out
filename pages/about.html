            <p>I made this site for people like me who are in a long distance relationship or friendship, and want to spend more time with their friend in whatever ways they can. Being physcially apart from someone you love can be hard at times, especially when you can't think of anything to do but just talk on the phone or video chat, which may seem like a task, or get boring after a while. With this tool, you can try new things in general, while spending time with the person you love yet sadly can't be around for the time being.</p>
            <p>
                I hope that people use this tool and get some inspiration of things to do with their long-distance friend, and hopefully can stay close for the period they're apart. It can be tough out there for people in this situation, so just know that it wont always be this way, and relationships are meant to change and grow overtime, and it is ok if it is different at one point or another.
